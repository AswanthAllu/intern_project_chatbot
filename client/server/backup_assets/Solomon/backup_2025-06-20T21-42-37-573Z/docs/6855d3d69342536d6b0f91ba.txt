Machine Learning Basics

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on developing systems that can learn from and make decisions based on data. It involves training algorithms to recognize patterns in data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so.

Key Concepts:
1. Supervised Learning: Learning from labeled training data
2. Unsupervised Learning: Finding patterns in unlabeled data
3. Reinforcement Learning: Learning through interaction with an environment

Common Applications:
- Image Recognition
- Natural Language Processing
- Recommendation Systems
- Fraud Detection
- Autonomous Vehicles
