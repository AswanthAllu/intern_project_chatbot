  "summary": "Based on the provided search results, the capital of India is **New Delhi**.\n\nWhile none of the search result descriptions explicitly state \"New Delhi is the capital of India,\" the titles of several results strongly suggest this:\n\n*   \"New Delhi | History, Population, Map, &amp; Facts | Britannica\" - the fact that Britannica has an entry for New Delhi is indicative of its importance.\n*   \"New Delhi - Wikipedia\" - Similar to Britannica, a Wikipedia entry suggests significance.\n*   \"What is the Capital of India?\" - all the results with this title will likely answer the question with New Delhi.\n\n**Limitations and Uncertainties:**\n\nThe provided search result descriptions are unfortunately lacking in detail. A more definitive answer would require accessing the actual content of the linked pages to confirm that they explicitly state New Delhi is the capital. However, based on the search results alone, New Delhi is the most reasonable and logical answer.",
